      <title>Brandeis University Senior Capstone Project</title>

      <description>About For my senior capstone project, I am working on a team of Olin students in collaboration with Brandeis University to redesign a piece of labratory hardware called the FlyBox. The FlyBox is designed to monitor and track the behavior of fruit flies over multiday periods for circadian rhythm research. The device was created to replaced existing methods of fruit fly behavior observation, offering more detailed and accurate data at a lower cost.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t really say too much about what I did at Markforged as a Software Intern due to me signining a non-disclosure agreement, but here is what I can say:
 I had the oportunity to work on the middleware that exists on the new FX20 printers I worked on some internal benchmarking tools I helped work on a new piece of software that reduces print processing time by around 7x I wrote some logging tools print file processing I worked primarily in Typescript and a tiny bit with Rust  To give you an idea of the stuff I was working on, here is a photo of the FX20 printer that I was working with.</description>

      <description>I worked as a robotics intern at Honda Development and Manufacturing of America, specifically at the Alabama Automotive Plant. While at Honda, I worked within the Weld 1 department where Honda vehicles are assembled and welded using several hundred Fanuc robots.
During my internship, I had the oportunity to see how robotic systems are used within the industrial and automotive industry. A few of the projects I worked on during my internship are the following:</description>

      <description>Overview I have been a member of Olin&amp;rsquo;s Baja SAE team since my freshman year. The team meets biweekly, during which we work on designing the year&amp;rsquo;s Baja vehicle in preparation for end of year competitions. During our own free time, we work on machining needed parts. I am on the suspension subteam which is responsible for the front and rear suspensions, front brakes, and steering. Through Olin&amp;rsquo;s Baja team, I have improved by CAD skills, learned how to preform FEA, and picked up many machining skills.</description>

      <description>In this project, I programed a Neato vacuuming robot to traverse an obstacle course. The Neato was placed in an arena with several boxes that served as obstacles. The goal was for the Neato to autonomously scan the environment using it&amp;rsquo;s LIDAR sensor, plan a course (avoiding the obstacles), and make its way to the goal object, a round barrel.
        On the left is the robot that I programed.</description>

      <description>In this project, I built a CNN machine learning model to identify hand poses in a game of rock paper scissors using PyTorch.

      <title>Rocky: Stabilization of an Wheeled Inverted Pendulum </title>

      <description>In this project, I helped design and implement a control system that maintains the balance of a wheeled inverted pendulum and corrects for angular disturbance.
For this project, we used a Pololu Balboa 32U4 robot kit as the robotic base with a set of 0.6 m long laser-cut MDF side extension to raise the center of mass and create the inverted pendulum. At the top of the robot are a set of weights, adding up to around 200g.</description>

      <title>Fully Autonomous Rover</title>

      <description>Overview With a team of 5 other Olin students, I helped built a fully autonomous rover that was capable of driving around campus. The Rover was capable of driving from point to point while preforming obsticle avoidance. The Rover also had a manipulator on the front that was capable of picking up and dropping items.
The rover navigated using a series of sensors. On the rover were two sonar sensors, five infrared distance sensors, a GPS module, and webcam capable of object recognition.</description>

      <description>I was the head of my HS robotics team during my Junior and Senior years. We competed in the MATE ROV competition were we had to build an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to preform a series of tasks. Here are a few images of the robots I helped build and design.
Our Rover         These was our final robot. The internals of the robot contained six motor controllers, an Arduino, and a Raspberry Pi.</description>

      <title>Object Recognition: Hot Dog or Not</title>
      <link>https://chrisallum.com/object-recognition/</link>

      <guid>https://chrisallum.com/object-recognition/</guid>
      <description>In this project, I created an algorithm that attempted to identify whether an image was a hot dog or not.
To build this algorithm, I first assembled a training set of 89 images of hot dogs. I then removed the background noise in each photo and re-oriented the hot dog so that it lay horizontal across the center of a 72x128 frame. I then vectorized each photo into a 9216x1x3 matrix (one column vector for each set of RGB value.</description>

      <title>Bio Inspired Hopper</title>

      <guid>https://chrisallum.com/bio-inspired-hopper/</guid>
      <description>For this project, I designed a &amp;ldquo;hopper&amp;rdquo; using a set of limited materials. The aim of this project was to learn more about design process, using CAD, and prototyping.
This was the first drawing of my hopper. I really wanted to incorporate a four-bar linkage as the primary jumping mechanism. I was also inspired by a how a grasshopper shoots it&amp;rsquo;s leg out to jump. These sources of inspiration are what lead me to this design.</description>
